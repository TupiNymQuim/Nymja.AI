# Nymja.AI

General Information:

Nymja.AI is an app that integrates the power of open-source generative large language models with the security of the Nym mixnet architecture.

Funded by Nym Tech, in a 6-month project, we will deliver an MVP, which allows the user to interact by text with Mistral’s LLM (Apache 2.0 license) running on top of Nym mixnet via a web application.

In a second stage of another 6 months (1/25-06/2025), it will be possible to extend the project to a production launch; with the service hosted remotely, having carried out intense batteries of tests and adding new features (such as audio and photo communication).

Nymja.AI is the solution that incorporates privacy into the most modern and powerful AI tools.
